Team Name: team dungeon or something
Team Members: Aiden Ashley

Build Idea: What I am trying to build is a dungeon game where you go through and fight enemies and collect gold and try to live for as long as possible. You will be able to buy healing items and I may add a boss fight you can activate as an end goal to the game depending on how far I get in the code.

Goal/Plan: I am going to be working on this when I have time and dont have a lot of stuff to do from my other classes. My goal is to make a game that is playable.
